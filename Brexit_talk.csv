1,"I was admitted on an Emergency on Saturday (chest pains, etc...). As usual, the people working in every A&E, as well as the ambulance service are mavericks, geniuses, kind, but I still had to wait six hours to get some time with a doctor. Probably half the nurses (and some of the doctors) were immigrants, you know, the kind we want to kick out of the country (like the 22,000 that have already left! in an insane populist rampage (and before anyone says points systems, I assure you that Visas are design to deter immigration, not promote it)."
2,"Boris Johnson makes Theresa May look like Winston Churchill. I absolutely can’t stand Jeremy Corbyn. Jo Swinson, you are unconvincing at best, alienating to most."
3,"I really hope after this election we get a new breed of politicians that care less about the Brexit wishes of the elite, the populist rampage, and more about what people need. In the meanwhile, I’m voting tactically and hoping that between the SNP, the LibDems, and the sane part of Labour this country can move forward, and also force the conservatives too bring better leadership. Or at least one that knows how many children they have...."
4,To give a counter (but as a Conservative hater) I went  to A&E with chest pains and was seen very quickly.
5,Because I was having a heart attack.
6,I didn't leave hospital for nearly three more weeks as I was prioritised for a bypass operation.
7,"I always say, if they're slow at A&E it's because your problem has been triaged as relatively non-urgent. It may be unpleasant for you, but it's better they put their most resource into those who are really, genuinely sick."
8,But fuck Boris.
9,"Ouch- I'm sorry to hear about that heart attack!  As an American whose family has gone through that, please let me offer some advice."
10,"I assume you asked the ambulance to take you to an 'in network hospital, even if it was further away.  This will limit your expenses to whatever your insurance's out-of-pocket annual max is.  Mine's around 5k for an individual, 12kish or so for the family.  Note: expect a huge bill that insurance won't want to cover for the ambulance.  Mine was around $500 for the pickup and like $75 a mile or something after that.  I forget exactly, but I ended up owing around $1000 to the city for that.  That was a surprise!"
11,"Be aware- even in network hospitals will use out-of-network  labs, surgeons, etc...   So you'll receive bills from many, many different places.  So also look at your out-of-network max (usually a few thousand more than the in-network) and expect to be billed that in addition to the in-network."
12,"After 4-6 months of getting all the bills, you should be able to work all the individual providers to get them grouped into the 'in network' bundle as the actual facility was in-network and they have to abide by that.  They won't want to, they'll drag their feet. But be very very persistent.  You'll still need to pay each one individually, but at the much lower rates."
13,"Eventually, when the dust settles, you'll owe many, many of thousands of dollars out of pocket.   This is where you need to understand who can be negotiated with.  Understand which will offer you discounts to pay in full, and which will offer you payment plans.  Also, some will send it to collections agencies that will let you settle for a fraction of the price."
14,"Be wary of independent labs.  They are the worst to deal with it seems and will send you to collections and destroy your credit right away, limiting your ability to buy a house, car, etc...  Even if they are wrong and should be charging you the in-network rates and using the in-network cap for you max expenses, it might be worth just paying the extra few hundred/thousand to get them of your back."
15,"If you need post-hospital treatment, see if you can possibly get it squeezed into that calendar year.  Otherwise your annual cap kicks in again and you'll own another $xx,000."
16,"This all assumes you have an excellent, $thousands / month private insurance plan.  If you don't, none of this applies to you.  You'll just need to find a bankruptcy lawyer as the hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs isn't something you can likely afford."
17,"Remember, bankruptcy only stays on your credit for like 5-7 years.  So eventually you can get a loan and buy a house/car or rent an apartment again!"
18,"Oh, and during all this, if you have any time or energy left, see if you can't take care of yourself. But that's not really the point of the medical system."
19,"Oh, wait, shit, I'm in the U.K. sub.  None of this applies to you...   Yet...  Soon though you can taste what Freedumb does to your medical system though!"
20,"The problem is, that there are people who devoutly believe that the problems the NHS face are entirely down to malingerers, foreigners, and people's poor lifestyle choices.  Some of them might blame the previous Labour government (that ended in 2010).  They'll continue to believe that regardless of how many visits to A&E they need to make.  They'll vote Tory in the hope that the Tories will punish people they've been told to hate."
21,"Apart from that, there are also people who recognise that there's a significant problem, but refuse to do anything about it, because they ""can't stand Jeremy Corbyn""."
22,"Edit: check out the comments on this s""tory"":"
23,https://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/i-was-trolled-for-posting-this-picture-of-my-daughter-218219/
24,I've seen people who claim to be NHS staff blaming it all on senior managers and whilst there is going to be some wastage and piss taking that happens in any organisation and is not the cause of the problems.
25,"The problem is, that there are people who devoutly believe that the problems the NHS face are entirely down to malingerers, foreigners, and people's poor lifestyle choices."
26,"Well most illness is due to poor diet, drinking, smoking, drugs and people not f*cking moving. And if people didn't get sick as often and as long the NHS wouldn't be understaffed and underfunded."
27,"I really hope after this election we get a new breed of politicians that  care less about the Brexit wishes of the elite, the populist rampage,  and more about what people need."
28,That was a good one. Try it over at r/jokes
29,Why are the Greens so unpopular in the UK?
30,Their policies are beyond radical.
31,100 BILLION every single year for 10 years in order to turn us carbon-neutral.  96% paid for by going into debt.
32,"I know that most numbers above about 100 million seem incomprehensible it just seems like 'a lot'.   But to put this into perspective, this is the same cost as building 40 different HEATHROW RUNWAYs A YEAR, for 10 years in a row."
33,Or doing 20 HS2 projects.   The thing people are going ballistic about costing a CRAZY amount of money.  Building 20 of them.
34,It's beyond crazy.
35,"First Past The Post, as much as some people love them (and a lot of people do still vote for them) the chances of a green candidate becoming an MP are slim to none, so most left-leaning people fall back to the much-more-likely-to-win Labour party."
36,"""I really hope after this election we get a new breed of politicians..."" Don't bet on it :("
37,"What is gonna motivate change. The same breed wins and loses every time, and we continue with the same breed into the next."
38,Sorry to disappoint you but they will...
39,Get well soon btw
40,Some people will vote to slit their own throats all based on urban myths. Hard to believe but stubbornness and ignorance don’t go well together.
41,What did the chest pains turn out to be?
42,A blood clot
43,"I don't understand people, including politicians, who know that the NHS is underfunded but still refuse to put more money in."
44,Yet it's the only place for serious emergency treatment in the UK.
45,"Any MP, if they or their family have a heart attack tomorrow, it doesn't matter if you have private insurance. You will be sent an NHS ambulance and taken to an NHS hospital where they will try their best to keep you alive. Doesn't matter if you have private health insurance, a private doctor etc. Only the NHS deal with serious emergency care."
46,"All parties are putting more in. That's the thing, and they see it as enough."
47,"Even in this election, Labour are offering just something like 0.6% more than conservatives."
48,"300,000 immigrants come into our country a year but that couldn't possibly have a knock on effect to the public services could it?"
49,"It does have a knock on effect, many of them end up working for the NHS."
